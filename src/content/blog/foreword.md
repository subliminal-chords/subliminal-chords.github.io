In the rapidly advancing digital age, the Internet has redefined the parameters of communication and learning. From the dawn of the digital era to the present day, the Internet has emerged as a beacon of connectivity, bridging geographical barriers and fostering a global village. Its ability to facilitate cross-cultural exchanges and promote a global perspective has been instrumental in enriching the educational process and preparing students to navigate the complexities of a multicultural world. The Internet's influence extends beyond the classroom walls, integrating seamlessly into our daily lives. It has revolutionized communication, allowing us to share information instantaneously, fostering camaraderie, and breaking down the traditional boundaries of space and time. Furthermore, the Internet has become a catalyst for innovation, driving economic growth, and influencing various sectors, including education and commerce.

And would you believe it if I told you - all that you just read was a fragment of the collective human knowledge about the Internet summarized by a machine? Yes, you probably would. Today. But imagine Tim Lee sitting at his desk at CERN in 1991 typing the first few words in the history of the Internet. What do you suppose would be his reaction to you saying there will one day be machines that can retrieve and summarize the information you need at the click of a button, or that his work will be the driving force behind this innovation?
